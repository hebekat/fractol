Fractol is one of the 42 University (https://42.fr/) projects.

The goal is to create a programm that displays diffrent fractals (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) from almost scratch

Requirements:

V.1  Rendering

•Your program must offer theJuliaset and the Mandelbrotset.
•The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of thecomputer). This is the very principle of fractals.
•You must be able to create different Julia sets by passing different parameters tothe program.
•A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will bedisplayed in a window.
◦You can handle more parameters to use them as rendering options.
◦If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displaysa list of available parameters and exits properly.
•You must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal. It’s evenbetter if you hack away on psychedelic effects.

V.2  Graphic management
•Your program has to display the image in a window.
•The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another win-dow, minimizing, and so forth).
•Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
•Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit theprogram in a clean way.
•The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.
